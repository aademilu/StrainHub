# StrainHub
Strainhub is designed as a web-based software to generate disease transmission networks and associated metrics from a combination of a phylogenetic tree and a metadata associated file. The software maps the metadata onto the tree and performs a parsimony ancestry reconstruction step to create links between the associated metadata and enable the construction of the network.
